**The SoRoSim Toolbox**

This is a MATLAB toolbox that uses the Geometric Variable Strain (GVS) approach to provide a unified framework for the modeling, analysis, and control of soft, rigid, and hybrid robots. The toolbox can be used to analyze open-, closed- and branched structures and allows the user to model many different external loading and actuation scenarios. Soft link should be modelled as a Cosserat rod, a 1D, slender rods accounting for bend, twist, stretch, and shear. While the rigid link can have any shape. MATLAB GUI assists creation of links, their assembly, assignment of DoFs, and the application of external and actuation forces. Toolbox can do more than static and dynamic analysis.

The examples folder of the toolbox contains some saved linkages and links you can run simulations for.

Find the overview of the toolbox, validation, and examples of problems that can be analized using SoRoSim in our IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine paper, "SoRoSim: A MATLAB Toolbox for Hybrid Rigid-Soft Robots Based on the Geometric Variable-Strain Approach"
