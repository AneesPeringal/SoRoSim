**The SoRoSim Toolbox**

This is a MATLAB toolbox that uses the Geometric Variable Strain (GVS) approach to provide a unified framework for the modeling, analysis, and control of soft, rigid, and hybrid robots. The toolbox can be used to analyze open-, closed- and branched structures and allows the user to model many different exernal loading and actuation scenarios. 

The examples folder of the toolbox contains some saved linkages and links you can run simulations for.

More details about the theorey behind the toolbox and some of its applications can be found on:
