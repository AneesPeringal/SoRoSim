Soft beam free fall. 0.5m soft beam with radius linearly varying from 2cm to 1cm.
Torsion and bending are enabled with a cubic strain.

SorosimLink (L1) and SorosimLinkage (T1) saved in FreeFall.mat
Enter T1.plotq0 to see the problem definition
After loading the .mat file run dynamic simulation by typing: T1.dynamics and static simulation by typing: T1.statics
Energy plot can be made by running energy.m after the dynamic simulation is complete
