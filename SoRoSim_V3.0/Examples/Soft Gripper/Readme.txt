Tendon driven Finger with 3 soft and 3 rigid links. Linear bending strain for the soft part.
Links (Rigid and Soft) and Linkage (Finger) saved in GripperFinger.mat
Enter Finger.plotq0 to see the problem definition
After loading the .mat file run dynamic simulation by typing: Finger.dynamics and static simulation by typing: Finger.statics (give actuator strength in the range -4 N to 0 N)
